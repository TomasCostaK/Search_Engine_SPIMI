You need to install the requirements with pip:

## How to Run
```python

    python3 main.py -h
```

### Usage 
```
Usage: python3 main.py 
	-t <tokenizer_mode: complex/simple> 
	-c <chunksize:int>
	-n <limit of docs returned:int> 
	-r <ranking_mode:tf_idf/bm25> 
	-a <analyze_table:boolean>

```
 * The tokenizer mode specifies if the tokenizer is **simple** or **complex**, and we know the complex one is better to analyze the text, since it deletes pronouns and commonly used words that are not related to the theme of the corpus.  

 * The number_lines defines the amount of lines you want to read at once, we recommend 8000-10000 for this document, since it doesnt slow down a lot but loads way less data into memory.

## Details
